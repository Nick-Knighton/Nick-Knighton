If the user selects login the program checks if a file has been created that stores the username and passwords.  If the file doesnt exist the program creates one.
The program asks the user to create a username and passsword.  THe username must be under 20 characters and the password must contain an upper case letter, lower case letter, number, and a symbol.

If the user selects login the program checks the stored values for the users inputted username and password.  If they match the user is logged in.
